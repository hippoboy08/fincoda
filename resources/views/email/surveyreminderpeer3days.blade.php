<p>Dear {!!$name!!}

<p>You are being invited to complete a questionnaire that explores your capacity for innovation within the workplace. The Fincoda Barometer Innovation Assessment Tool has been developed to help organisations and individual’s identify their current capacity to innovate and particular areas for development.</p>

<p>If you complete the questionnaire, a personalised development report will be available to download from the platform following completion. By completing the questionnaire, you are providing your consent for this report and your responses to be shared with your line manager.</p>

<p>Your responses will be stored securely by your organisation within the Fincoda platform and will be shared only with yourself and your manager. Anonymised responses will be combined with the rest of the organisation's data for analytical purposes. However, individual responses will be unidentifiable – team and organisational reports will only be generated when there are at least eight individual’s responses.</p>

<p>To access the questionnaire, please follow this link: <a href="http://fincoda.turkuamk.fi">http://fincoda.turkuamk.fi</a></p>

<p>If you have any queries, please contact <a href="https://www.fincoda.eu">www.fincoda.eu</a></p>
